<h3>Platform Overview</h3>
<br>
<p>MyTeams is a server and CLI client-based collaborative communication platform that supports team communication and organization. Users can create teams, join and leave teams, and create channels and threads for focused discussions.</p>
<p>The platform is designed to handle multiple clients simultaneously, using select for command management. The server saves its internal information in the current folder and loads it when it restarts, ensuring seamless operation across sessions.</p>
